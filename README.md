#  MY DRINK README

## Installation Instructions
- Open the zipped file, open the 2203ProjectPlan zipped file, then open the MyDrink folder, and finally open the MyDrink.xcodeproj
- No pods are installed. I used SwiftSDK packages this time which are installed through xcode

## Hardware requirements
- A laptop or computer with xcode and an emulator or a device that can be used as an emulator. preferrably and iPhone 11 emulator

## Login Requirements
- The email is all lowercase : myemail@gmail.com 
- The password is exactly as written: Miranda
- You can play around with typing the correct email and a wrong password to see the error label you get.
- You can also type in a new email with a new password and see that the buttons change to help you create an account

## Known Bugs
- The only bug I currently know of is not being able to add a place yet. Also, an alert is supposed to appear if you try to add a place that has blank text fields, but the alert does not pop up.
- Added places are saved to Firebase but they will not update on the view controller and I cannot figure out how to get that functionality to work properly

## Special requirements
- I know there was an issue with opening and running my project last time and I don't know why. That is why I have compressed the entire folder that my xcode project is in. Hopefully that works for you to be able to open it because there are no pods. When you open the file, clean the build folder and then run it. That helped me once.
